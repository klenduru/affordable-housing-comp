## Question of interest

To investigate housing equity in New York City, we will compare the
proportion of very low-income and middle-income affordable housing units
produced between 2014 and 2024.

Specific Question: Is there a statistically significant difference in
the proportion of very low-income housing units compared to
middle-income housing units developed in NYC from 2014 to 2024?

## Description of the data

The data is published on NYC open data and was collected by the
Department of Housing Preservation Development. The Department of
Housing Preservation Development generates reports on projects,
buildings, and units that began development after January 1, 2014. These
datapoints are counted towards either the Housing New York plan
(1/1/2014 - 12/31/2021) or the Housing our Neighbours: A Blueprint for
Housing and Homelessness plan (1/1/2022 - present).

Data collection method could be administrative tracking of affordable
housing development projects and comprehensive documentation of projects
initiated after January 1, 2014.

The key variables are very low income units (Numerical), middle income units (Numerical), and
project completion date (Floating Timestamp). Each row of data is a different housing project or preservation project
that has been developed since 2014. The dataset, unfiltered, has 4634 rows and 19 columns. When filtered into a month-wise aggregation, it has 12 months per year for every year from 2014 to 2024.

## Outline of the graph

1.  Bar Chart of Housing Units

X-axis: Income Categories (Very Low, Middle) Y-axis: Number of Units
Purpose: Compare absolute number of units by income level Shows visual
representation of unit distribution

2.  Pie Chart of Unit Proportions

Slices representing:

Very Low Income Units (%) Middle Income Units (%)

Purpose: Illustrate percentage breakdown of housing units Highlights
relative proportion of each income category


3.  Time Series Line Graph

X-axis: Years (2014-2024) Y-axis: Number of Units Points showing:

Very Low Income Units per month Middle Income Units per month

Purpose: Show unit production trends over time

## Type of inference method

We are using a difference in two population proportions. Comparing the
proportions of two specific income housing unit categories: - Very Low
Income vs Middle Income units

Our key statistical metrics would be proportions of very low income
units, proportions of middle income units, z-statistic, p-value,
confidence intervals.
